/*
   🕒 AUDIT DATE: September 15, 2025
   📋 AUDIT STATUS: COMPLETE
   ✅ OVERALL HEALTH: EXCELLENT

   🎯 AUDIT SCOPE:
   - TypeScript compilation issues
   - Import/export consistency
   - React import standardization  
   - Circular dependency analysis
   - Package.json configuration
   - Preset functionality verification
   - Core library functionality review

   📊 FINDINGS SUMMARY:

   ✅ PASSING CHECKS:
   1. ✅ TypeScript Compilation: Clean build with zero errors
   2. ✅ Core Functionality: cs() function working correctly
   3. ✅ Theme System: Properly implemented with theme object
   4. ✅ className Global System: setupClassName() compiles and functions
   5. ✅ Export Consistency: All exports properly defined in index.ts
   6. ✅ Package.json: Proper export paths for main, preset, global modules
   7. ✅ Preset Auto-setup: Automatically calls setupClassName() on import
   8. ✅ Build Output: All lib/ files generated successfully
   9. ✅ Dependencies: Proper peer dependencies and optional AsyncStorage
   10. ✅ React Native Utils: All utilities exported and accessible

   🔧 ISSUES FOUND & FIXED:

   1. ⚠️ FIXED: React Import Inconsistency
      - ISSUE: reactNativeUtils.ts used `import React from "react"` 
      - OTHER FILES: Used `import * as React from "react"`
      - FIX: Standardized to namespace imports across all files
      - IMPACT: Ensures consistent React usage and prevents potential module resolution issues

   🏆 QUALITY INDICATORS:

   ✅ Zero TypeScript compilation errors
   ✅ Consistent import patterns throughout codebase
   ✅ Proper error handling with console.warn/error for debugging
   ✅ Clean separation of concerns between modules
   ✅ Well-structured export system with proper type definitions
   ✅ Comprehensive utility coverage for React Native features
   ✅ Robust theme system with dark mode support
   ✅ Multiple className patching strategies for maximum compatibility

   📈 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS VERIFIED:

   ✅ Style caching implemented in cs() function
   ✅ Memoization for responsive hooks
   ✅ Efficient breakpoint checking
   ✅ Optimized color parsing and theme resolution
   ✅ Smart cache invalidation on theme changes

   🛡️ SECURITY & STABILITY:

   ✅ Safe error handling in all async operations
   ✅ Graceful fallbacks for missing AsyncStorage
   ✅ Protected against circular dependency issues
   ✅ Try-catch blocks around critical patching operations
   ✅ Proper TypeScript strict mode compliance

   📦 PACKAGE STRUCTURE VALIDATED:

   ✅ Main export: lib/index.js (✓ exists)
   ✅ Preset export: lib/preset.js (✓ exists, ✓ auto-setup)
   ✅ Global export: lib/global.js (✓ exists)
   ✅ Type definitions: All .d.ts files generated
   ✅ Side effects: Properly declared for preset and global
   ✅ Files array: Includes all necessary build artifacts

   🧪 TESTING FRAMEWORK READY:

   ✅ Debug utilities available for development
   ✅ Comprehensive console logging for troubleshooting
   ✅ Multiple test files created for validation
   ✅ Error boundaries implemented in theme provider
