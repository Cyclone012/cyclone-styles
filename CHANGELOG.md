# Changelog

All notable changes to CycloneWind will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.2] - 2025-09-15

### Fixed

- Hardened global className setup to avoid errors in Expo/React 18 environments where `React.createElement` is exposed via a getter and RN component properties are non-configurable
- Added safety checks using `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor` before attempting to patch `React.createElement`
- Avoid redefining non-configurable React Native component properties; rely on module-level proxy and JSX runtime interception instead

### Enhanced

- **Universal Module Patching**: Replaced hardcoded React Native module detection with universal system that works with any module exporting React components
- **Smart Component Detection**: Enhanced heuristics to identify React components from any library (react-native, @react-native-community, expo, custom libraries)
- **Dynamic Component Discovery**: Removed hardcoded component lists in favor of intelligent runtime detection based on component patterns and properties
- **Module-Agnostic Architecture**: System now automatically detects and wraps React components regardless of their source module or library
- **Flexible Global Import**: Added `cyclonewind/global` import that can be used anywhere in the app (not just at the first line) - automatically enables className support when imported from any location

### Notes

- If direct patching is skipped, CycloneWind will automatically fall back to JSX runtime interception and universal module-level wrapping, keeping `className` working without crashes
- The patching system now works universally with any React component library, not just react-native

## [1.0.1] - 2025-09-15
